# What
Otherwise known as "off payroll", IR35 affect contractors in PSC (private service companies - limited) providing work, and is used to determine who is responsible for paying NI and PAYE. This is because many individual contractors have abused the system paying themselves the minimum in PAYE/NI, with the rest in dividends.

Rather than correcting the tax rules, HMRC is moving the burden of who pays tax. The end hirer must assess whether the role falls within IR35 scope, and must provide you with a **"Status Determination Statement"**.

If within IR35, then the end hirer deducts PAYE and NI for what they pay you.  If outside IR35, the responsibility for PAYE/NI rests with the contractor's PSC.

If it is later deemed that the decision to be outside of IR35 was wrong, the end hirer is responsibile for back paying the PAYE/NI; hence it is essential that all PSCs get the "Status Determination Statement".

# When
