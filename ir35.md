# What
Otherwise known as "off payroll", IR35 affect contractors in PSC (private service companies - limited) providing work, and is used to determine who is responsible for paying NI and PAYE. This is because many individual contractors have abused the system paying themselves the minimum in PAYE/NI, with the rest in dividends.

Rather than correcting the tax rules, HMRC is moving the burden of who pays tax. The end hirer must assess whether the role falls within IR35 scope, and must provide you with a **"Status Determination Statement"**.

If within IR35, then the end hirer deducts PAYE and NI for what they pay you.  If outside IR35, the responsibility for PAYE/NI rests with the contractor's PSC.

If it is later deemed that the decision to be outside of IR35 was wrong, the end hirer is responsibile for back paying the PAYE/NI; hence it is essential that all PSCs get the "Status Determination Statement".

# When
Comes into force 6th April 2020 for the private sector, having been in use for a few years in public sector.

# Who
Does not apply to a small company. A small company is defined by companies house ([ref](https://www.itcontracting.com/ir35-small-company-exemption/)):
    * Turnover – not more than £10.2 million
    * Balance sheet total – not more than 5.1 million
    * Number of employees – no more than 50

# Restrictions
You can work on multiple contracts at the same time or within a given tax year, each having different IR35 status.

If within IR35, although PAYE and NI are deducted at source you don't benefit from other employee rights, such as, paid holiday, sickness, health/dentist benefits. Self assessment will need to be used to claim tax relief on pension payments. No more daily subsistence or travel expenses.

# Contracts
Under IR35 it is all the circumstances of the arrangements, including the working practices that are relevant. The strongest evidential source for demonstrating the actual working practices will usually be a written agreement between the relevant parties, but only if this can reasonably be relied upon as an accurate representation of the facts. It is important to remember that there are continual changes in the law and specialist legal skills are required to review, draft and negotiate contracts effectively to accurately reflect the actual working practices. For this reason it is often best to engage specialist contract draftsman with IR35 expertise to ensure commercial risks are mitigated and IR35 issues are properly and accurately dealt with.

## Nature of Work and Schedules
First and foremost, the work must be described accurately and for IR35 purposes should be either a project or projects, or have some form of deliverable that is consistent with a discrete piece of work that is not ongoing. It is fundamentally important that the description in the contract is accurate, as you will be contractually bound to deliver the stated services.

## Right of Control
Old style standard agency contracts usually contain a clause requiring the contractor to be under the direction, supervision and control of the client. Such a clause should always be avoided, leaving method and manner of performance for the contractor to decide.

## Substitution
The substitution clause has received much publicity as the panacea to cure all IR35 ills. Whilst this approach is simplistic it is an important clause to look out for in a contract. The right need not be unfettered (not many clients will realistically agree to an unfettered right) but must be valid. Caution should always be exercised before relying on a substitute clause to avoid IR35, unless substitution has actually taken place. The relevant clause must be a genuine right to substitute and many clauses we have seen fall well short of what is required.

## Mutuality of Obligation
An ongoing obligation to provide work and do work provided should not be an explicit or implicit term of the contract. Further work should be under a separate contract. Provisions enabling the client or agency to extend without the consent of the contractor should be avoided.

## Termination
Generally a 'contract for services' (i.e. which is not likely to be affected by IR35) is for a specific project and will end when the project is completed (or alternatively if there is an early breach of the contract). It is therefore advisable to link the contract duration to timeframes for completion of the actual services.

## Financial Risk
Running a genuine business enterprise appropriate to a contractor intending to operate outside IR35 usually involves taking on a level of financial risk. Financial risk can exist in many ways such as incorporating indemnity provisions, agreeing to fix faulty work or maintaining professional indemnity insurance.

## Payment terms
Payment terms should reflect those that exist between commercial companies rather than those that exist for employees, so payment should always be contingent on invoices being issued. Many professionals and sole traders charge an hourly or daily rate without compromising their self-employment status, so whilst fixed price contracts are ideal, payment based on time can be acceptable.

## Exclusivity
It is entirely inappropriate for an independent contractor to be unduly restricted from providing services for other clients.

### Equipment and Premises
If the working arrangements are such that elements of the work are to be performed from the contractor's own premises then it is clearly inappropriate for the contract terms to stipulate a fixed client site as the sole location for performance of the services.

## Intention
As the intention of the parties is not to create a relationship of employer/employee, a clause should confirm the independence of the parties and that there is no relationship of employment. To support this intention it is important to avoid language and concepts usually only found in an employment context such as procedures for notification of absence, references to misconduct or overtime.
