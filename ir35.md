# Inside IR35 - sole trader, umbrella or PSC?
## Umbrella
Through an umbrella, they calculate and take PAYE and NI before then paying you NET pay into a personal bank account. Rates vary from a percentage (stay well clear of theses) and fixed rate - anywhere from £100 to £150 per month (this is higher than most accountant fees).

> Some offer benefits, such as, sick pay and holiday - how?
> And what happens when you're in between assignments?

And as an _eomployer_, they are responsible for paying into a workplace pension or personal pension.

If always working through an umbrella company, you don't need to complete Self Assessment, unless you have other sources of income (shares/bank interest, rents, or you need to offset pension or charity payments).


## PSC
You can still be taxed at source - by the agency (they take PAYE and NI), but they pay you into your PSC business account. This could remain an advantage if working on a mix of inside and outside IR35 contracts.

You can draw down your salary as an expense - with no tax cost. The most efficient way will be to draw down all NET each month, keeping profit to a minimum (zero) - because otherwise, you will then pay corporation tax on it (so pay tax twice!). Be sure to draw down all as expense before paying any dividends (_of which are subject to 35% tax at higher rate_).

You can draw down as expense only part of the NET pay, leaving some for those months whereby you're not in contract, but eqaully if you draw down all each month, then you can you personal savings accoutns for the times you're not in work which will earn you interest too (and having to file self asessment).

You can continue to run you company, VAT registered. The agency must pass on the VAT to you, and you must continue to submit quartley tax rturns digitially.

If flat rate registered, then the minimual amount you make on the VAT saved (3.5%) could be used to continue to run your business overheads while working on an inside IR35 contract. For example, paying business mobile fun, online accounting software (I used clearbooks - including their payroll package) and subscriptions (in my case lucidcahrts, github, AWS and IET), business bank account costs (if relevant - mine has a minumum number of transactions).

This option makes sense if:
1. You are already well-versed running you PSC so PAYE and VAT do not scare you or over burden you, or you are using an accountancy firm and they will continue to do this for you.
2. There is a high chance you will work on both inside and outside IR35 contracts - there are many devops/developer roles being advertised as outside IR35 - remember, it only applies to medium and large companies. Start-ups are not impacted, and the UK could be going through a tech revolution.

## Umbrella and PSC?
You could work through an unbrella while working on an Inside IR35 contract, and through your PSC while working on Outside IR35 contracts.

You should be aware of your PSC turnover - because you'll need to monitor it in cases of being VAT registered (April 2019 - £86k per year). You'll also need to be able to switch between paying PAYE and not, so be able to manage employees.

You'll have costs associated with both - the service charge of the umbrella, yet still having to maintain business accounts, accountants & filing PAYE and VAT (if you prefer to do this yourself).

# What
Otherwise known as "off payroll", IR35 affect contractors in PSC (private service companies - limited) providing work, and is used to determine who is responsible for paying NI and PAYE. This is because many individual contractors have abused the system paying themselves the minimum in PAYE/NI, with the rest in dividends.

Rather than correcting the tax rules, HMRC is moving the burden of who pays tax. The end hirer must assess whether the role falls within IR35 scope, and must provide you with a **"Status Determination Statement"**.

If within IR35, then the end hirer deducts PAYE and NI for what they pay you.  If outside IR35, the responsibility for PAYE/NI rests with the contractor's PSC.

If it is later deemed that the decision to be outside of IR35 was wrong, the end hirer is responsibile for back paying the PAYE/NI; hence it is essential that all PSCs get the "Status Determination Statement".

# When
Comes into force 6th April 2020 for the private sector, having been in use for a few years in public sector.

# Who
Does not apply to a small company. A small company is defined by companies house ([ref](https://www.itcontracting.com/ir35-small-company-exemption/)):
    * Turnover – not more than £10.2 million
    * Balance sheet total – not more than 5.1 million
    * Number of employees – no more than 50

# Restrictions
You can work on multiple contracts at the same time or within a given tax year, each having different IR35 status.

If within IR35, although PAYE and NI are deducted at source you don't benefit from other employee rights, such as, paid holiday, sickness, health/dentist benefits. Self assessment will need to be used to claim tax relief on pension payments. No more daily subsistence or travel expenses.

# Contracts
Under IR35 it is all the circumstances of the arrangements, including the working practices that are relevant. The strongest evidential source for demonstrating the actual working practices will usually be a written agreement between the relevant parties, but only if this can reasonably be relied upon as an accurate representation of the facts. It is important to remember that there are continual changes in the law and specialist legal skills are required to review, draft and negotiate contracts effectively to accurately reflect the actual working practices. For this reason it is often best to engage specialist contract draftsman with IR35 expertise to ensure commercial risks are mitigated and IR35 issues are properly and accurately dealt with.

## Nature of Work and Schedules
First and foremost, the work must be described accurately and for IR35 purposes should be either a project or projects, or have some form of deliverable that is consistent with a discrete piece of work that is not ongoing. It is fundamentally important that the description in the contract is accurate, as you will be contractually bound to deliver the stated services.

## Right of Control
Old style standard agency contracts usually contain a clause requiring the contractor to be under the direction, supervision and control of the client. Such a clause should always be avoided, leaving method and manner of performance for the contractor to decide.

## Substitution
The substitution clause has received much publicity as the panacea to cure all IR35 ills. Whilst this approach is simplistic it is an important clause to look out for in a contract. The right need not be unfettered (not many clients will realistically agree to an unfettered right) but must be valid. Caution should always be exercised before relying on a substitute clause to avoid IR35, unless substitution has actually taken place. The relevant clause must be a genuine right to substitute and many clauses we have seen fall well short of what is required.

## Mutuality of Obligation
An ongoing obligation to provide work and do work provided should not be an explicit or implicit term of the contract. Further work should be under a separate contract. Provisions enabling the client or agency to extend without the consent of the contractor should be avoided.

## Termination
Generally a 'contract for services' (i.e. which is not likely to be affected by IR35) is for a specific project and will end when the project is completed (or alternatively if there is an early breach of the contract). It is therefore advisable to link the contract duration to timeframes for completion of the actual services.

## Financial Risk
Running a genuine business enterprise appropriate to a contractor intending to operate outside IR35 usually involves taking on a level of financial risk. Financial risk can exist in many ways such as incorporating indemnity provisions, agreeing to fix faulty work or maintaining professional indemnity insurance.

## Payment terms
Payment terms should reflect those that exist between commercial companies rather than those that exist for employees, so payment should always be contingent on invoices being issued. Many professionals and sole traders charge an hourly or daily rate without compromising their self-employment status, so whilst fixed price contracts are ideal, payment based on time can be acceptable.

## Exclusivity
It is entirely inappropriate for an independent contractor to be unduly restricted from providing services for other clients.

### Equipment and Premises
If the working arrangements are such that elements of the work are to be performed from the contractor's own premises then it is clearly inappropriate for the contract terms to stipulate a fixed client site as the sole location for performance of the services.

## Intention
As the intention of the parties is not to create a relationship of employer/employee, a clause should confirm the independence of the parties and that there is no relationship of employment. To support this intention it is important to avoid language and concepts usually only found in an employment context such as procedures for notification of absence, references to misconduct or overtime.
