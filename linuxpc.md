# PC
* Intel i7
* 32GB DDR3 (2*16GB)
* PNG GeForce 2000 4*DP 5GB graphics card
* 1TB Intel M2 SSD - boot and OS disk (it's fast!)
* 2*2TB SSD/HDD RAID disks - data disk (RAID1 - mirror for data availability).

# OS
Fedora is my preferred Linux distro. Good regular updates. Good open source community.

Fedora 29 latest at time of install. Fedora default desktop is Gnome 3; I like it, many don't. But I also like the Mate desktop too. Can install multiple desktops and switch.
