# Topics
## pipelines
Data is processed in a composition of stages, to filter and transform. Called pipleines, after the UNIX pipe. Run on the server not the client (driver).

```
db.userColl.agreegate([
	{ < stage 1 > },
	{ < stage 1 > },
	...
], options)
```

## Operators
`$match`, `$group` and `$project` are aggreation operators;. they must appear as the start of each stage.

`$gte` and `$in` are query operators.

## Expressions
Expressions are a lot like functions; they always appear in a "value" position. They provide additional document properties. Expressions may take a single argument or an array of arguments.

e.g. (where `<gravityOnEarth>` and `<weightOnEarth>` are fixed values. :
```
	myWeight: { $multiply: [$divide: [ "$gravity.value", <gravityOnEarth>], <weightOnEarth>] } }
```

## Variables
`$` prefixed names are field paths in the documents presented to that stage; that includes any new fields added by previous stages from expressions.

There are a few system variables and they are always in uppercase, e.g. `$$CURRENT` (current document).

And finally there are user varaibles, having a `$$` prefix too (for convention, do not use uppercase user variables).
 
 
 ## $match (filter)
 https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/match/
 
 Some come as early in stages as possible, and can be repeated many times in a single aggregation. Uses the standard MongoDB query syntax.
 
 Cannot use the `$where` operator.
 
 If using `$text` operator, then it must be the first stage in the piepline.
 
 ## $project
 `$project` operator is much more powerful than that available i n the `find` operator. As an aggregation operator, `$project` can return expressions, which can create new fields. Should be used aggresively to keep document set as small as possible. Can be used in as many stages are required.
 
 "object.paths" must be withon quotes. If assigning an "object.path" to another document property, must prefix "$" on the right hand side of the assignment:
 ```
 {
	 $project: {
		 _id:0,
		 gravity: "$gravity.value",
		 myWeight: { $multiply: [$divide: [ "$gravity.value", 9.8], 72] } }
	 }
 }
 ```

  ## $addFields
	Similar to `$project` in that it can add addtiional fields to the document; but it can only add fields, unlike project which can _rename_ and _show/hide_. But it is the _show/hide_ aspect of `$project`, which as soon as you project a calculated field, you have to add other fields you need in the document.
	
```
aggregate([
	{
		$addFields: {
			gravity: "$gravity.value",
			myWeight: { $multiply: [$divide: [ "$gravity.value", 9.8], 72] } },
		}
	}
]);
```

Works well combining both `$project` and `$addFields`.

## $geoNear
`$geoNear` must be the first stage in a pipeline. `$geoNear` can be used on shared collections, whereas `$near` (prior to V4.0) could not be used on shared collections: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/near/.

Both (`$goeNear` and `$near`) sort the documents. But unlike $near, `$geoNear` as an aggregration pipeline can then have subsequent transformations and sorting applied (unlike `$near`).

Restriction to uising `$geoNear` is that each document must have just one geo index.

`$geoNear`, in addition to `min`/`max`/`limit`/`num` filtering (note limit and num are idenitical in restricting the number of results), but `$geoNear` has the `query` property to which takes a find query to pre filter on documents. This reduces the resultset, which is important given `$geoNear` must be the first stage in a pipeline (so before `$match`).
 
 
 ## Cursor Stages
 This includes `$sort`, `$skip`, `$limit` and `$count`.
 
 `$skip` implies `$sort` first to assure order of documents; without `$sort` get the natural order (the order the documents were inserted).
 
 Note the use of `$` prefix on the sort field path.
 
 ```
 db.movies.aggregate([
	{
		$match: {
			"imdb.rating": { $gte: 7 },
			"rated": { $in: ["PG", "G"] },
			"languages": { $all: ["English", "Japanese"] },
			"genres": { $nin: ["Crime", "Horror"] },
		}
	},
	{
		$sort: { "$imdb.rating": -1 }
	},
	{
		$skip: 3
	},
	{
		$limit: 1
	}
])
```

 ```
 db.movies.aggregate([
	{
		$match: {
			"imdb.rating": { $gte: 7 },
			"rated": { $in: ["PG", "G"] },
			"languages": { $all: ["English", "Japanese"] },
			"genres": { $nin: ["Crime", "Horror"] },
		}
	},
	{
		$count: "$genres"
	}
])
```

Note, `$count` stage must be the last stage, because it returns a single document with field name of the count field, e.g.:

```
{
	genres: 3
}
```

For more flexible counts, use the group stage.

`$sort` has a memory limit of 100MB; if the dataset to sort exceeds this, it returns an error. Passing the option `allowDiskUse`allows for sorting of large datasets.

When `$sort` is followed by a `$limit`, MongoDB aggregation optimises this pipeline to only store the given number of documents as defined in limit. `$sort` can only utilise a document index, if the stage appears before a `$match`, `$group` and `$project` stage.

## $sample
Can return a _ramdon_ set of documents from a given set (namely, after a match/addFields/group stage):

```
...
	{
		$sample: { size: N }
	},
...
}
```

If `N` <= 5% of the documents passed into the stage and the staged _documentset_ (ergo recordset)  has more than 100 documents **AND** the $sample is the first stage, then documents are chosen in a psudedo random way.

If none of those conditions are met, MongoDB will apply a "random sort" - and it therefore subject to the 100MB limit.

## $group
Just one argument in this stage, that of the `_id` field - used as matching/group criteria. The criteria can be a simple field in the source set of documents and even a calculated expression or a combination of fields. The `_id` appears in the resulting set of documents from this stage.

The $group allows for accummulation operators.

```
...
	{
		$group: {
			_id: "$year",
			numberOfFilms: { $sum: 1 },
			totalRating: { $sum: "$imdb.rating" },
		}
	},
...
```

```
...
	{
		$group: {
			_id: {
				numDirectors: {
					$cond: [
							$isArray: "$directors",
							{ size: "$directors" },
							0
					]
				}
			},
			numberOfFilms: { $sum: 1 },
			avgRating: { $avg: "$imdb.rating" },
		}
	},
...
```

Accummulators (sum, avg, min, max, bucket, et al) will ignore any documents where the field does not exist, and thus may result in a null value.

An `_id` of null will result in accummulators being applied across all documents.

Sometimes it is require to work on the `$first` or `$last` document within a `$group` document set; this is more true when workjing with multi-dimensional group.


### Accummulators in $project
Accummulators can be used in both `$project` (`$addFields`) stages in addition to `$group`. When used in `$project`, the accumulators only run on arrays within the document not across documents as is the case in `$group` stage.

Restricted accummulators are:
* avg
* min
* max
* stdDevPop
* stdDevSamp

For example:

```
...
	{
		$project: {
			_id: 0,
			max_high: {
				$max: "$trends.avg_high_tmp"
			},
			min_low: {
				$min: "$trends.avg_low_tmp"
			},
			avg_high: {
				$min: "$trends.avg_high_tmp"
			},
			high_diviation: {
				$stdDevPop: "$trends.avg_high_tmp"
			},
		}
	},
...
```


More complex accummulators would require use of the `$reduce` operator.

```
...
	{
		$project: {
			_id: 0,
			max_high: {
				$reduce: {
					input: "$trends",            <-- this in array within a document
					initialValue: -Infinity,
					in: {
						$cond: [
							{ $gt: ["$$this.avg_high_tmp", "$$value"] },    <-- this is the current value of the reduce and this is the current document
							"$$this.avg_high_tmp",                          <-- if condition is true
							"$$value"                                                 <-- if condition is false
						]
					}
				}
			},
		}
	},
...
```

## unwind
Creates a duplicate document for each array entry for a field within the document; you cannot sensibly `$group` on a document field that is an array, because the order of the items within the document's array field is important - ["apples","oranges"] will be a separate group to ["oranges","apples"], and even ["apples","Apples"] will not match ["apples"].

Typically `$unwind` comes after a `$match` with `$project` (to ensure minimum set of input documents) and before a `$group`.

Short form:
```
...
	{
		$unwind: "$<field.path>",
...
```

Long form:
```
...
	{
		$unwind: {
			path: "$<field.path>",
			includeArrayIndex: "<string>",              <--- the name of the field to be included in document with the index within array
			preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: <boolean>,
	}
...
```

## $lookup
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/

```
{
   $lookup:
     {
       from: <collection to join>,
       localField: <field from the input documents>,
       foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
       as: <output array field>
     }
}
```

`$lookup` retrieves the entire document.

The `from` collection cannot be sharded and must be in the same database. `localField` and `foreignField` are matched on equality.

## $graphLookup
Graph (tree) hierarchy; atypical on social networks. Uses [transitive closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_closure).

```
{
	$graphLookup: {
		from: <colllection to join>,
		startWith: <expression for the value to start from>,
		connectFromField: <field name from connect from>,
		connectToField: <field name to connect to>,
		as: <resulting field name>,
		maxDepth: <number of iterations - optional>,
		depthField: <field name for the numbber of iterations to reach "this" node => 0 for the first lookup - optional>,
		restrictSearchWithMatch: <match condition to apply to the lookup - optional>
	}
}
```

**Unlike the standard `$lookup` operator, this `$graphLookup` has an expressive "match" operator.**

A simple example, to find those who report to a given person, given `{ "_id" : 2, "name" : "Eliot", "title" : "CTO", "reports_to" : 1 }` where the relationship between parent and child is given in the child document:
```
{
	$match: { name: "Eliot" }
},
{
	$graphLookup: {
		from: "parent_reference",
		startWith: "$_id",
		connectFromField: "_id",
		connectToField: "reports_to",
		as: "all_Reports",
	}
}
```

Returns:
```
{
	"_id" : 2,
	"name" : "Eliot",
	"title" : "CTO",
	"reports_to" : 1,
	"all_Reports" : [
		{
			"_id" : 11,
			"name" : "Cailin",
			"title" : "VP Cloud Engineering",
			"reports_to" : 5
		},
		{
			"_id" : 10,
			"name" : "Dan",
			"title" : "VP Core Engineering",
			"reports_to" : 5
		},
		{
			"_id" : 6,
			"name" : "Ron",
			"title" : "VP PM",
			"reports_to" : 2
		},
		{
			"_id" : 9,
			"name" : "Shannon",
			"title" : "VP Education",
			"reports_to" : 5
		},
		{
			"_id" : 7,
			"name" : "Elyse",
			"title" : "COO",
			"reports_to" : 2
		},
		{
			"_id" : 5,
			"name" : "Andrew",
			"title" : "VP Eng",
			"reports_to" : 2
		}
	]
}
```

To find those whom a given person reports to (flip):
```
{
	$match: { name: "Eliot" }
},
{
	$graphLookup: {
		from: "parent_reference",
		startWith: "$reports_to",
		connectFromField: "reports_to",
		connectToField: "_id",
		as: "bosses",
	}
}
```

Returns:
```
{
	"_id" : 2,
	"name" : "Eliot",
	"title" : "CTO",
	"reports_to" : 1,
	"bosses" : [
		{
			"_id" : 1,
			"name" : "Dev",
			"title" : "CEO"
		}
	]
}
```

`$graphLookup` can be used to follow the graph where the parent/child relationship is defined within the parent document:

```
db.child_reference.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { name: "Eliot" }
  },
  {
    $graphLookup: {
      from: "child_reference",
      startWith: "$direct_reports",
      connectFromField: "direct_reports",
      connectToField: "name",
      as: "all_reports",
    }
  }
])
```

Returns:
```
{
	"_id" : 2,
	"name" : "Eliot",
	"title" : "CTO",
	"direct_reports" : [
		"Andrew",
		"Elyse",
		"Ron"
	],
	"all_reports" : [
		{
			"_id" : 11,
			"name" : "Cailin",
			"title" : "VP Cloud Engineering"
		},
		{
			"_id" : 10,
			"name" : "Dan",
			"title" : "VP Core Engineering"
		},
		{
			"_id" : 5,
			"name" : "Andrew",
			"title" : "VP Eng",
			"direct_reports" : [
				"Cailin",
				"Dan",
				"Shannon"
			]
		},
		{
			"_id" : 7,
			"name" : "Elyse",
			"title" : "COO"
		},
		{
			"_id" : 6,
			"name" : "Ron",
			"title" : "VP PM"
		},
		{
			"_id" : 9,
			"name" : "Shannon",
			"title" : "VP Education"
		}
	]
}
```

### Depth
We may not always be interested in the the full depth of the tree. The immediate children/parent are obtained with a `maxDepth` of 0. To find the grandchildren/grandparents, `maxDepth` of 1. `maxDepth` is the number of recursions by documents.

Include the `depthField` attribute with the name to present a field to present the depth of the given document.

```
db.child_reference.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { name: "Eliot" }
  },
  {
    $graphLookup: {
      from: "child_reference",
      startWith: "$direct_reports",
      connectFromField: "direct_reports",
      connectToField: "name",
      as: "all_reports",
      maxDepth: 1,
      depthField: "level"
    }
  }
])
```

Returns:
```
{
	"_id" : 2,
	"name" : "Eliot",
	"title" : "CTO",
	"direct_reports" : [
		"Andrew",
		"Elyse",
		"Ron"
	],
	"all_reports" : [
		{
			"_id" : 11,
			"name" : "Cailin",
			"title" : "VP Cloud Engineering",
			"level" : NumberLong(1)
		},
		{
			"_id" : 10,
			"name" : "Dan",
			"title" : "VP Core Engineering",
			"level" : NumberLong(1)
		},
		{
			"_id" : 5,
			"name" : "Andrew",
			"title" : "VP Eng",
			"direct_reports" : [
				"Cailin",
				"Dan",
				"Shannon"
			],
			"level" : NumberLong(0)
		},
		{
			"_id" : 7,
			"name" : "Elyse",
			"title" : "COO",
			"level" : NumberLong(0)
		},
		{
			"_id" : 6,
			"name" : "Ron",
			"title" : "VP PM",
			"level" : NumberLong(0)
		},
		{
			"_id" : 9,
			"name" : "Shannon",
			"title" : "VP Education",
			"level" : NumberLong(1)
		}
	]
}
```

### Cross Collection Graph Lookups
The above examples looked up documents within the same collection, but `$graphLookup` is not restricted to looking up in the same collection, e.g:

```
db.air_airlines.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { name: "TAP Portugal" }
  },
  {
      $graphLookup: {
        from: "air_routes",
        as: "connections",
        startWith: "$base",
        connectFromField: "dst_airport",
        connectToField: "src_airport",
        maxDepth: 1
      }
  }
])
```

This will give all destinations with up to one connecting flight from the base airport of "TAP Portgual", joining `air_airlines` against `air_routes`.

But this will give all destinations for all carriers (airlines). We may prefer to stay with the same airline. This is where the `restrictSearchWithMatch` field comes into play:

```
db.air_airlines.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { name: "TAP Portugal" }
  },
  {
      $graphLookup: {
        from: "air_routes",
        as: "connections",
        startWith: "$base",
        connectFromField: "dst_airport",
        connectToField: "src_airport",
        maxDepth: 1,
				restrictSearchWithMatch: { "airline.name": "TAP Portugal"}
      }
  }
])
```


### General Considerations
Owing to recursion, `$graphLookup` is likely to require a lot of memory; `$allowDiskUse` is your friend.

Indexes should accelerate most queries. When using $graphLookup, index upon the `connectToField`.

The `from` collection (as with `$lookup`) cannot be a sharded collection.

## Facets
The ability to present query results in multiple dimensions (facets). The results of one query and then be used to further restrict subsequent queries using one or more of the facets returned. Facets can be navigated within the aggregation pipeline.

Facetting is an analytics capability: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search. Amazon Web Shop uses faceted queries; you do a general search and then on the left hand side it should a set of categories and options within categories based on those initial search results. Selecting one of more narrows down the search results further.

### Single Facets
`$sortByCount` is the easiest way to return query results ordered by a given dimension:

```
db.companies.aggregate([
	{
		$match: { $text: { "$search": "network" } }              // assumes the companies collection has a text index
	},
	{
		$unwind: "$offices"
	},
	{
		$match: { "offices.city" : { $ne : '' } }
	},
	{
		$sortByCount: "offices.city"
	}
])
```

Note, the above will not return the matching documents, but the analytical data of the matched documents as simply a reverse ordered list of counts based on one dimension (in this case, "offices.city"):

```
...
{ "_id": "San Francisco", "count": 245 },
{ "_id": "New York", "count": 218 },
...
```

### Buckets
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/bucket/

```
{
  $bucket: {
      groupBy: <expression>,
      boundaries: [ <lowerbound1>, <lowerbound2>, ... ],
      default: <literal>,
      output: {
         <output1>: { <$accumulator expression> },
         ...
         <outputN>: { <$accumulator expression> }
      }
   }
}
```

`groupBy` must **resolve to a single value** within the given document set.

All values within a boundaries array must be of the same type. `Infinity` and `-Infinity` are reserved.

An error is retured if any of the documents resolve the `groupBy` to a value not in the `boundaries` set; use `default` to prevent error and assume a value.

E.g. Using the _movies_ collection (note, imdb.rating if it exists is from 1 to 10):

```
db.movies.aggregate([
	{
		$bucket: {
			groupBy: "$imdb.rating",
			boundaries: [0, 5, 8, Infinity],
			default: "Not Rated"
		}
	}
	])
```

Returns:
```
{ "_id" : 0, "count" : 4992 }
{ "_id" : 5, "count" : 35516 }
{ "_id" : 8, "count" : 2284 }
{ "_id" : "Not Rated", "count" : 1705 }
```

The `$bucket` operator in addition to just counting documents in each bucket, allows for expressive calculations on documents within each bucket, with the specification of one of more `output` fields projected into the resulting document set e.g.

```
db.movies.aggregate([
  {
    $bucket: {
      groupBy: "$imdb.rating",
      boundaries: [0, 5, 8, Infinity],
      default: "Not Rated",
      output: {
        average_per_bucket: { $avg: "$imdb.rating" }
      }
    }
  }
])
```

Gives:

```
{ "_id" : 0, "average_per_bucket" : 4.038561698717949 }
{ "_id" : 5, "average_per_bucket" : 6.593591620678004 }
{ "_id" : 8, "average_per_bucket" : 8.246234676007006 }
{ "_id" : "Not Rated", "average_per_bucket" : null }
```

Note, `count` has disappeared from the results. This is because `count` is the default output expression if not `output` given:

```
db.movies.aggregate([
  {
    $bucket: {
      groupBy: "$imdb.rating",
      boundaries: [0, 5, 8, Infinity],
      default: "Not Rated",
      output: {
        average_per_bucket: { $avg: "$imdb.rating" },
        count: { $sum: 1 }
      }
    }
  }
])
```

`$bucketAuto` simplies defines the number of buckets required, and MongoDB will generate the buckets evenly distributing documents across each buckets. `granularity` is an optional argument to `$bucketAuto`, and is a predefined set of algorithms to be more predictable in resulting bucket sets. For example, the "POWERS_OF_2" granularity will create buckets like: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128... `$bucketAuto` will return "_id" fields as documents with `min` and `max` sub fields.


 # Exercises
 ## $match:
 
 ```
 
db.movies.aggregate([
	{
		$match: {
			"imdb.rating": { $gte: 7 },
			"rated": { $in: ["PG", "G"] },
			"languages": { $all: ["English", "Japanese"] },
			"genres": { $nin: ["Crime", "Horror"] },
		}
	}
]).itcount();



var pipeline = [
	{
		$match: {
			"imdb.rating": { $gte: 7 },
			"rated": { $in: ["PG", "G"] },
			"languages": { $all: ["English", "Japanese"] },
			"genres": { $nin: ["Crime", "Horror"] },
		}
	}
];
```

## $project with expressions
Counting number of words in the movie title and returning those with only one word in the title:
```
db.movies.aggregate([
	{
		$project: {
			_id: 0,
			title: 1,
			titleSplit: { $split: [ "$title", " "]},
		}
	},
	{
		$project: {
			title: 1,
			titleSplit: 1,
			numberOfWords: { $cond: { if: { $isArray: "$titleSplit" }, then: { $size: "$titleSplit" }, else: 1} },
		}
	},
	{
		$match: {
			numberOfWords: 1
		}
	}
]);
```

Mapping writers having `<name (role>)` format to just `<name>`:

```
db.movies.aggregate([
	{
		$match: { writers: { $exists: true } },
	},
	{
		$project: { writers: 1, cast: 1, _id:0 },
	},
	{
		$project: {
			oldWriters: "$writers",
			writers: {
				$map : {
					input: "$writers",
					as: "thisWriter",
					in: {
						$arrayElemAt: [
							{ $split: [ "$$thisWriter", " (" ] },
							0
						]
					}
				}
			},
		},
	}
])
```

Labour of Love (optional extra lab)  - returning the number of document the same person appears in the directors, cast and writers sets - uses `setIntersection` expression within `project`:
```
db.movies.aggregate([
  {
      $match: {
      writers: { $exists: true },
      cast: { $exists: true },
      directors: { $exists: true },
    },
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      cast: 1, directors: 1,
      writers: {
          $map : {
              input: "$writers",
              as: "thisWriter",
              in: {
                  $arrayElemAt: [
                      { $split: [ "$$thisWriter", " (" ] },
                      0
                  ]
              }
          }
      },
    },
  },
  {
    $project: {
      labourOflove: {
        $size: {
          $setIntersection: [
            "$writers",
            "$directors",
            "$cast",
          ]

```

## cursor stages
Returns the 25th movie in the set of movies ordered by number of favourite casts:
```
db.movies.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      "tomatoes.viewer.rating": { $gte: 3 },
      countries: "USA",
      cast: { $exists: true },
    },
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id:0,
      title:1,
      cast:1,
      "tomatoes.viewer.rating": 1,
      numFavorites: {
        $size: {
          $setIntersection: [
            ["Sandra Bullock", "Tom Hanks", "Julia Roberts", "Kevin Spacey", "George Clooney"],
            "$cast",
          ]  
        }
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $sort: {
      "numFavorites": -1,
      "tomatoes.viewer.rating": -1,
      "title": -1
    }
  },
  {
    $skip: 24
  },
  {
    $limit: 1
  },
])
```

Note - the match stage on `cast` to prevent null being returned from `$setIntersection`.

## Bringing It Together
The normalised rating is the average of the number of _IMDB_ votes and _IMDB_ rating, but votes is anywhere from not present to 1521105, so can't just average votes and rating. _IMDB_ rating is between 0 and 10. Therefore, the number of votes has to be scaled between 1 and 10, before calculating the average.  The handout had the formula for scaling votes. 

```
db.movies.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      "imdb.rating": { $gte: 1 },
      "imdb.votes": { $gte: 1 },
      released: { $gte: ISODate("1990-01-01T00:00:00Z") },
      languages: "English",
    },
  },
  {
    $project: {
      "imdb.rating": 1,
      "imdb.votes": 1,
      released: 1,
      title: 1,
      languages: 1,
      scaled_votes: {
        $add: [
          1,
          {
            $multiply: [
              9,
              {
                $divide: [
                  { $subtract: ["$imdb.votes", 5] },
                  { $subtract: [1521105, 5] }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $addFields: {
      normalized_rating: {
        $avg: [ "$scaled_votes", "$imdb.rating" ]
      },
    }
  },
  {
    $limit: 10
  },
  {
    $sort: { "normalized_rating": 1}
  },
  {
    $limit: 1
  },

]).pretty()
```

## groups
Here the only challenge was in the match. I was inititally just matching on `/Oscars?/`, but the values were not as expecting. I had to prefix the match with "Won" to get the target set of documents, because there are documents where `awards` is for example "Nominated for 2 Oscars. Another 1 win."

```
db.movies.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      awards: /^Won.*[0-9]+.*Oscars?/,
    },
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 1,
      title: 1,
      awards: 1,
      rating: "$imdb.rating",
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      average_rating: {
        $avg: "$rating"
      },
      lowest_rating: {
        $min: "$rating"
      },
      highest_rating: {
        $max: "$rating"
      },
      deviation_rating: {
        $stdDevSamp: "$rating"
      },
    }
  },
]).pretty();
```

## unwind
