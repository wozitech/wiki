# pipelines
Data is processed in a composition of stages, to filter and transform. Called pipleines, after the UNIX pipe. Run on the server not the client (driver).

```
db.userColl.agreegate([
	{ < stage 1 > },
	{ < stage 1 > },
	...
], options)
```

# Operators
`$match`, `$group` and `$project` are aggreation operators;. they must appear as the start of each stage.

`$gte` and `$in` are query operators.

# Expressions
Expressions are a lot like functions; they always appear in a "value" position. They provide additional document properties. Expressions may take a single argument or an array of arguments.

# Variables
`$` prefixed names are field paths in the documents presented to that stage; that includes any new fields added by previous stages from expressions.

There are a few system variables and they are always in uppercase, e.g. `$$CURRENT` (current document).

And finally there are user varaibles, having a `$$` prefix too (for convention, do not use uppercase user variables).
 
 
 # $match (filter)
 https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/match/
 
 Some come as early in stages as possible, and can be repeated many times in a single aggregation. Uses the standard MongoDB query syntax.
 
 Cannot use the `$where` operator.
 
 If using `$text` operator, then it must be the first stage in the piepline.
 
 
 # Exercises
 #$match:
 
 ```
 
db.movies.aggregate([
	{
		$match: {
			"imdb.rating": { $gte: 7 },
			"rated": { $in: ["PG", "G"] },
			"languages": { $all: ["English", "Japanese"] },
			"genres": { $nin: ["Crime", "Horror"] },
		}
	}
]).itcount();



var pipeline = [
	{
		$match: {
			"imdb.rating": { $gte: 7 },
			"rated": { $in: ["PG", "G"] },
			"languages": { $all: ["English", "Japanese"] },
			"genres": { $nin: ["Crime", "Horror"] },
		}
	}
];
