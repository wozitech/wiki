<!-- SUBTITLE: M201 Performance -->

# Overview
Does not include tuning and sizing.

Requires a local database: `docker run --name mongodb-m201 -p 27017:27017 -d mongo:latest`:
```
mongo
use m201;
exit

mongoimport -d m201 -c people ./people.json
```

## Hardware Considerations
RAM is 25 times fatser SSD, which up to  5 times faster than HDD.

MongoDB works best when everything runs in RAM.

WiredTigfer protocol benefits from a multi-threaded CPU.

MongoDB recommends RAID10 if usning RAID. MongoDB discourage RAID5 and RAID6 (has good redundancy but not performance) and RAID0 (has good performance but no redundancy). MongoDB also recommend using separate disks for OS, logs, indexes and data.

As a distrubted database, MongoDB is dependent on network IO, with primary/secondary cluster nodes, read replicas and shards. The network IO plays heavily into `Write Concern` and `Read Concern` controlled via the application's client connection via the driver.
