# Arrays
Arrays in documents are first class citizens. In MongoDB, `find({ "countries" : "UK"})` will match all documents where the "UK" is one of the `countries` array elements.

If wanting to match on multiple array elements:
* `find({"countries" : { $all : ["UK", "USA"]}})` - will match those documents where countries is "UK" and "USA" only.
* `find({"countries" : { $in : ["UK", "USA"]}})` - will match those documents where countries is either "UK" and/or "USA" only.
