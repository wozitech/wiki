A flexible data model; only prereq is a primary key and data is stored in BSON.

The fact that MongoDB is schemaless is more a benefit than a requirement. Schema (document validation) can be associated to a collection; a schema itself can be flexible.

When considering the data model, you must consider:

And remember, these change over time, and therefore, the flexible model of MongoDB allows for changes over time.

Although historically, the MongoDB approach has been, stored everything in one document up to
