<!-- SUBTITLE: The base platform of WIT mobile applications -->

# Background
`wit-mobile` showcases WOZiTech skills using React and Redux to build rich UI interactive web applications. As a mobile application, it is to be deployed to Windows, Apple and Android devices alike, phones and tablets, leveraging the native experience to be enjoyed on each platform. Initial thoughts were on using Apache Cordova as the cross-platform runtime, able to support any web based technology. But React Native, from the clever fellows at Facebook, is cross-platform albeit specific to React applications only.

Given `wit-mobile` is a platform to showcase React, then React Native is an obvious choice for cross-platform deployment.
# Reference
Will be following [this article](https://medium.com/the-web-tub/creating-a-cordova-hybrid-app-with-react-redux-and-webpack-13fe24b6b272) for my first application example. And deployment to iOS/Andorid using React Native as covered by [this article]().
