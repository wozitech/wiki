# Hardware Technology
Most of WIT (WOZiTech) products will resolve around the Raspberry PI. `wit-pi` is a custom Operating System provided by WOZiTech, with a set of customised peripherals, such as, proxity sensors, touchpads, pin pads, webcams, IP Cameras, motors, temperature sensors, solenoids, electrostatic sensors, et al, and installing WIT applications built specifically for the `wit-pi`, to provide tailored access solutions. For example, security, entertainment (music/movie streaming) and/or automation.

Note, you may observe some projects/products may be called by a slight variant in name: `wit-o` prefix. These are odroid alternatives; XU-4 (with 8 CPUs concurrent performance) or CU-2 (fast calculations) are required. More power than Raspberry PI, odroids are more expensive and much tricker to work with (it took me two weeks just to get Ubuntu Mate 16.04 installed to the XU-4!!!!).

# Software Technologies
All `wit-pi` applications will be using:
* [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) - one of the best JS frameworks for building responsive applications
* [Quaser Framework](http://quasar-framework.org/) - quality UI components for VueJS
* [Electron (JS)](https://electronjs.org/) - for running JS apps (like VueJS) natively on the Raspberry PI
