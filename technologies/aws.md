<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of AWS -->

# Overview
AWS is a public cloud provder, with an extensive set of resources available on a pay per use (subscription) price model. A public cloud makes it easy to get into new technology, because you can start small and grow as load on your application/service grows.


## VPC
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) unique describes the hosted provision of a given customer environment; it's a virtual data centre. Each customer account can have upto five VPC (default; can be increased) and every customer's VPC is unique to that customer, thus providing the separation of each customer's environment.
