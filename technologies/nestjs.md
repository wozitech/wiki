<!-- SUBTITLE: nest.js - Well structured MVC with dependency injection node.js REST/GraphQL progressive framework-->

# Introduction
Effectively Angular for the backend, a typescript framework with:
1. Controllers - routers
2. Providers (Services) - workers/model
3. Interfaces - well defined data structures for controllers and providers
4. Schema - GraphQL schema
5. Modules - for stitching controlers, services, GraphQL schema and interfaces to build more complex APIs (more complex the app, the less microservice it is)
6. Dependency Injection - loosely coupled
