# Overview
Ory is an open source project, focused on authentication and authorisation services. It is composed for four projects:
* [Hydra](/technologies/ory/hydra) - a hardened API-only oAuth2/OpenID compliant Authentication Server - orchestrates the process whereby a client application makes a request on your server application for permission to your services.
* [Oathkeeper](/technologies/ory/Oathkeeper) - a plugin Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules
