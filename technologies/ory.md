# Overview
Ory is an open source project, focused on authentication and authorisation services. It is composed for four projects:
* [hydra](/technologies/ory/hydra) - a hardened API-only oAuth2/OpenID compliant Authentication Server - orchestrates the process whereby a client application makes a request on your server application for permission to your services.
* [oathkeeper](/technologies/ory/Oathkeeper) - a plugin Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules
* [kratos](/technologies/ory/kratos) - a  Identity and User Management
* [keto](/technologies/ory/keto) - permission server that implements best practice access control mechanisms
